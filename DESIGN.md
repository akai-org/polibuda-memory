### Initial version by Marcin Lawniczak

## Overview of the idea

A simple in-browser memory game with faculty, deans and rectors of our university, with a twist.
Not only do you have to match a pair, you do also have to match the name and their academic title.

## Must have

- Basic functionality of memory game
- Flippable cards
- Randomised starting position of cards
- Include all members from the dean level up for each faculty
- Count wrong attempts

## Nice to have

- Scoring
- Challenge board
- Ability to easily change pictures/titles (JSON file?)
- Professors from each faculty
- Separate slideshow to learn beforehand
- Ask the user for faculty first, then include members of said faculty.

## Side ideas

- Make a foldable printout (folds to credit card format), with faces and names for portable use,
customisable per faculty (You don't really need to know the Dean of Faculty of Architecture when you're studying physics).

## Resources

- Each Faculty has a site that showcases it's employees, it usually contains pictures.
